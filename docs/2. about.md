jQuery.promises is a collection of tiny scripts that provide a promise interface
for common tasks. Currently, there are only two scripts: jQuery.promises.image,
which wraps image elements that may or may not have been loaded by the browser
and jQuery.promises.timer, which wraps `setTimeout()` delayed functions.

Take a look at slides for the Promises, Promises talk given by the jQuery.promises
authors at Async, in Brighton, UK.

Code contributions and feedback is welcome.
